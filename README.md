# SimpleHighLow

This is a simple high low game where the program creates a random number from 1 to 10 then the user is prompted to guess a number depending on the users guess the computer will give a response if the guess was higher or lower than the random number and the user will be prompted to guess again. A counter is also nvolved to determine how many guesses it takes the user to get the correct answer. When the correct random number is guessed a message saying how many attempts it took along with a correct message.

I used this website for information on using the random library in Python: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/random-number#:~:text=To%20generate%20random%20number%20in,is%20defined%20in%20random%20module.
